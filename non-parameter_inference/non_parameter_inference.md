## non-parameter models
The model structure is not specified a priori but is determined from data.The term non-parametric is not meant to imply that such models completely lack parameters but the number and nature of the parameter are flexible and not fixed in advance
- A histogram is a simple non-parameter estimate of a probability distribution.
- Kernel density estimation provides better estimates of the density than histograms
<!-- - Non-parametric regression and semi-parameter regression methods have been developed based on kernels,splines(样条函数), and wavelets -->
- Data envelopment analysis provides efficiency coefficients similar to those obtained by multivariate analysis without any distributional assumption
- KNNs classify the unseen instance based on the **K** points in the training set which are nearest to it.
- A support vector machine(with a Gaussian kernel) is a non-parametric large-margin classifier

**Non-parametric**(or **distribution-free**) **inferential statistical methods** are mathematical procedures for statistical hypothesis testing which,unlike parameter statistics,make no assumptions about the probability distributions of the variables being assessed.
